Tic-Tac-Toe game with a little twist

What it is -> a game similar to tic-tac-toe, but instead of marking spaces, we can stack goblins on top of each other and also move them within the playing area. The winner is the first to have three goblins in a row/column/diagonal. It is essential to remember the positions of the goblins.

How to start and play -> The game starts with player 1 - the green goblin. The only action the program allows us to do is to click on the goblin we want to move and then on the square on the playing field where we want to move it. To make the game more exciting, each subsequent round is started by the player who lost the previous game.
